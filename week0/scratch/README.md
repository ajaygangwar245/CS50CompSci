# Intelligent Puppy Show

Hello, everyone this is my scratch project named **Intelligent Puppy Show**! In this interactive Scratch project, you'll meet Kia's intelligent puppy, **Dot**, who can perform mathematical calculations for you. 

## Features

- **Sprites**: The project uses two sprites, one being Dot (the puppy), and the other as a helper for tasks.
- **Scripts**: Multiple scripts handle user inputs, calculations, and displaying results.
- **Conditional Logic**: The tasks are conditional, ensuring Dot performs the correct operation based on user choices.
- **Loops and Variables**: Loops help repeat actions, and variables track user inputs and results.
- **Custom Blocks**: Custom blocks are used to perform repetitive operations and simplify the code.

## Project

- **Complexity**: The project is complex as it uses custom blocks, multiple sprites, multiple scripts, variables, loops, and conditionals.
- **Abstraction**: Sequences of code blocks have been abstracted into custom blocks for easier understanding and maintenance.
- **Step-by-Step Progress**: The development process involves creating small parts of the project, testing frequently, and refining the design along the way.

## CS50x: CS50's Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains all of my programs and projects I have completed as part of Harvard's **CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python** course. Each file and folder in this repository will serve as a collection of my work throughout the course, including assignments, projects, and any additional exercises.

## About the Course
CS50x is Harvard University's entry-level course in computer science designed to teach fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques using Python language. Topics covered include:

- **Algorithms**: Searching, sorting, and optimization techniques
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and trees
- **Memory**: Understanding how data is stored in memory and how to manage it
- **Software Engineering**: Building software, debugging, and optimizing performance
- **Web Development**: Basics of front-end and back-end web development
- **Security**: Basic security concepts such as encryption and cryptography
- **Programming Languages**: Scratch, C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Flask.


## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
📂 CS50CompSci
├── 📁 Week0
│   ├── 📁 Problem Sets
├── 📁 Week1
│   ├── 📁 Problem Sets
...
├── 📁 Final Project
│   ├── 📁 portfolio-website
```

Each folder corresponds to a week/module of the course, and the files inside represent individual assignment problems, exercises, or projects.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the code in this repository.

1. Ensure you have installed all the required resources.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajaygangwar245/CS50CompSci.git
   cd CS50CompSci
   ```

3. Navigate to the file's directory and execute it:

   ```bash
   cd foldername
   python filename.py
   ```
## Installations
To run the programs on your local machine, you will need to install the following:
1. **Git**: Version control system to clone this repository.
2. **Python**: To run Python-based programs.
3. **C Compiler**: To compile C programs.
4. **Required Libraries**: Flask
5. **IDE**: Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text or any other IDE you're comfortable with.

## Course Highlights
Some of the key projects and assignments include:

- **Problem Solving Skills**: Learned how to approach and solve complex computational problems systematically.
- **Final Project**: A capstone project that demonstrates the application of concepts learned throughout the course. (Develop a website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Flask(Python))

## Feedback and Contributions
I am continually learning and improving. If you have suggestions or find ways to optimize my code, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaboration is always welcome!
